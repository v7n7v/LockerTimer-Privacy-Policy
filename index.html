Privacy Policy for UTC Timer & Screen Locker<br>
Effective Date: June 15, 2025<br>

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application "UTC Timer & Screen Locker" ("Application") for mobile devices that was created by Alula Gebreegziabher.<br>

What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?<br>
No User-Provided or Automatically Collected Information<br>

The Application is designed with user privacy as a fundamental principle. It does not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal information or sensitive data from you or your device.<br>

The Application's sole purpose is to display the current Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and to lock the device's screen upon user request. All functionality of the Application occurs entirely on your device (client-side), and no data is ever sent to us or any third party. It does not require you to create an account, provide a name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information. The Application does not use any analytics tools, advertising networks, or other third-party services that would collect data about you or your usage.<br>

Application Permissions<br>
To perform its core function of locking the screen, the Application may require the following permission:<br>

Device Administrator Permission: This permission is requested for the single, express purpose of allowing the Application to lock the device's screen when you activate this feature. The Application does not use this permission for any other purpose. The permission can be revoked at any time through your device's security settings.<br>

Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information<br>
As we do not collect any personal data, there is no data to retain or manage.<br>

Childrenâ€™s Privacy<br>
We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. The Application does not collect any personally identifiable information, making it safe for all audiences. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that their child has provided us with information without their consent, they should contact us. Since we do not collect data, we will not have any to delete, but we are happy to address any concerns.<br>

Changes<br>
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.<br>

Your Consent<br>
By using the Application, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. The term "processing" in this context refers only to the core, non-personal functions the app performs on the device itself to display the time and lock the screen.<br>
